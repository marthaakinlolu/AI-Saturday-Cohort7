But tori be say e break di Academy rule for international productions, wey say foreign contenders for di Oscars must get ""mainly non-English tok-tok"". Dis one mean dey must speak dia local language  more dan dem speak English. Lionheart na 95 minutes long and na only 11 minutes inside di whole feem wey dem no speak English. Dis decision pain some Nigerians well-well onto say di kontri official language na English - dat ""informate"" na wetin Lionheart director and actress, Genevieve Nnaji tok. She tweet say ""dis feem show how we dey tok as Nigerians,"" Dis include English, wey dey act as bridge between di ova 500 language dem wey we dey speak for our kontri.""  ""We know choose who colonise us,"" na wetin she add put. Nigeria na former British colony for 160 years before e gain independence for 1960. But dis no be di first time wey dem don disqualify international feem before for di same reason. For 2015 dem say Afghanistan Utopia feem and Israel di Band Visit film for (2007) get ""too much English"" inside dem too. Or di first time wey di Academy don backtrack when it get to do with nominations or even awards. See di oda feem wey dem snub. Dem bin nominate Francis Ford Coppola mob feem for 11 categories for 1973 Oscars and dem win three awards- including best picture, best actor and best adapted screenplay. But dem lose out for di best soundtrack even before di ceremony start: dem withdraw di nomination afta di Academy find out say Nino Rota wey compose di music bin don use some music from im work for one Italian comedy for 1958.

Im no attend di ceremony. But Chaplin receive another honorary Oscar for 1972.  Dis na di first and only case for di history of Oscars wey dem carry statuette go.

Dia reason na say di feem dem bin show am for theatre for October 1967, wey disqualify for di 1968 season. High Society na popular musical feem wey dem do for 1957 and na Grace Kelly last work before she become princess of Monaco. Di Academy bin make mistake to nominate di members of di feem for best motion picture story, award wey dem dey give original movies. Di problem be say High Society no qualify as e dey based on one 1940 movie Di Philadelphia Story. 13 hours:  Di Secret Soldiers of Benghazi na 2016 action feem wey dey based on 2012 US Consulate attack for Libya city.  E no do well for box office and get one single Oscar nomination - for sound mixing.

Im start to tink about tins wey im love to do during e childhood.   ""Well, first of all I don dream of to own my own record store... I dey always collect music wen I be small boy.  ""I see am as natural way to go afta I leave school to continue di hobby of my childhood,"" na so Tejuoso tok.  Di Jazzhole, wey currently dey for Awolowo Road for Nigeria commercial capital, Lagos, first open business for 1991 for smaller space elsewhere in di city.   Nowadays, for time wen Afrobeats dey enjoy airplays for radio and for nightclubs, Di Jazzhole position imself as custodian of a different type of music.  As a result, di record and book shop na one of Lagos favourite hideaways to go back in time and enjoy old school records through contemporary ears.  ""We open primarily to sell jazz and African music essentially, black music essentially with an emphasis on."" Vibrant jazz scene bin dey for 1990s, but e don now give way to oda types of music. ""[My customers] na men wey get money and CDs bin dey new den. Dem bin no dey just buy, dem also understand di music becos dem don actually see a lot of di musicians.  ""Dem don travel go abroad before and get enough money to go to festivals."" Tejuoso say dis days pipo get more appetite for jazz funk and smooth jazz.   ""Di younger generation dey a bit different from wen we bin dey grow up.""  Di Jazzhole na also di venue for live performances. Tejuoso say di live events start as way to sell di music.  ""You get to remember say we bin dey operate before internet come. Dat time di only way to sell records na either you use radio or you find ways to draw pipo into di shop. So you get show and den you sell di records and den you spread di word."" Di Jazzhole don welcome many performers wey include Asa, Brymo and most recently Nneka.  While Tejuoso tink about di memorable events of di 90s, im call e wife, wey be co-owner of di shop, to ask for her own.  ""For me na still di [Fatai Rolling] Dollar days. In terms of musicianship, na those old guys,"" na so she tok.  Tejuoso look back on wen one of di pioneers of highlife music, Fatai Rolling Dollar, share stage wit singer Keziah Jones.  ""Just di interaction or di combination of someone from dat period [di 1950s] wit musicians from di 90s.  ""I find am interesting and also di audience too, di fact say we dey work wit older generation musician and dey able to actually attract younger audience."" ""Di Asa one I no go forget am. I no go forget am becos many pipo bin dey dia, di shop bin dey bubble,"" na so im wife tok.   As di demand for music by African artists begin grow, Tejuoso see am as duty to not just be pesin wey dey keep music but also as producer. Dis wan make am to start e own label for 1995.  ""In di 90s, most of di stuff we bin dey get we dey import African music from Europe or somwia abroad. ""I just wake up one day and say at least we suppose get our own wey we dey produce and export too. Dat na how we take start wit label."" Despite say di iazz scene now dey different and dey exist side by side with more popular types of music, Tejuoso believes say room dey for Jazz to do well for dis market.  ""If jazz go get any future here, e go need to turn into our own language. We go need rework am into our DNA in a way."" Artists and ogbonge pipo like Malian singer Salif Keita, Black Panther actors Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira and King Mohammed VI of Morocco don visit di store.  Wit plenti books, CDs and vinyl records, di scent of coffee wey dem dey make and di sound of jazz for di background, Di Jazzhole don position imself as di spot for lovers of jazz.  ""For me, jazz dey more serious wia pipo dey actually come to listen to di music and not smoke and drink over di music. Jazz na different way of just receiving di vibe of music"".

Even though Joshua lose dis fight, rematch clause dey for di contract wey di two fighters sign. E go give am opportunity to reclaim di belts just like im bin do wen e fight Andy Ruiz.

Usyk starts well Joshua attempt right hand blow to Usyk body, but e miss. Usyk dey prove tricky to nail down in di opener, di Ukrainian fit don take di first round. Joshua dey struggle to find e target. Right hand blow to di body from Joshua and dat punch briefly force Ukrainian on di back foot. Joshua trie to find right hook to blast im way through, but Usyk gloves soak up di power. Usyk land with powerful shot to di head, Joshua momentarily dey hurt. But Joshua land with right hand for di final seconds of di third and e lead to huge roar from di home fans. Three gone and Usyk, dey show great footwork and dey so mobile, im dey win di fight so far. Another jab from Usyk land for Joshua face. One big overhand from Joshua, maybe im best punch of di contest so far, lands, but Usyk bin dey move backwards so e no take am at full whack. Joshua best round of di fight so far, dat na di fourth, but di fight fit still go either way. Usyk, wey dey stone lighter than Joshua, dey faster, getting in and out and dey move fantastically well. Joshua don begin to show e power and dat definitely be im best round and doubt no dey say im take dat round. E don give Usyk something to think about. Joshua fit put e foot on di accelerator now and build on dat success? Dis round dey quieter, Joshua trie to swing im right hand, but Usyk still dey full of energy and dance im way backwards and out of danger. Joshua dey in di middle of di ring for di sixth, as im try to pressure Usyk and e hit beautiful straight right hand to Usyk chin. Dat one go pain am, but e no send Usyk down. We dey halfway. A very enjoyable watch. Straight counter right from Joshua, but wait just a minute, left hook from Usyk and Joshua wobble backwards. Di champ dey in trouble. Dat left wey rock Joshua leave am off balance, but e stay up and Usyk bin dey too far away to land with follow-up. Joshua fit don start to take some risks. Im land with right and dat na good start. Im now dey mix am up with good shot to di body and straight right rock Usyk back a bit, but not as dramatically as Joshua bin dey rocked a round earlier. Round 9 Anthony Joshua get warning for holding Usyk down. Di last thing Joshua need na to get point deduction from e total. But just a warning from Michael Alexander. Usyk get cut, just above di right eye. Dat go prove crucial? A huge roar from di crowd as Joshua now get visible target to aim for. Blood over Usyk eye. But Joshua also get some damage, e right eye don swell up. Usyk with one, two, three left hands to di face moving forward in succession. Good work from di Ukrainian. Joshua fit dey in throw-the-kitchen-sink territory now. Four minutes to go. Round 12 Usyk land couple of punches just before di round end as Joshua look defenceless.

Afta di fight dem ask am about wetin go wrong, di defeated Briton say: ""I no fit see for di ninth round, I no fit see anything really because my eye don close.  ""Na good experience because in adversity you have to learn to control yourself, stay on top of things, so when I no fit see anything - na di first time e dey happen in a fight."" Hearn bin tok say Joshua bin give Usyk, age 34, too much respect and e go need to make ""fundamental changes"" to regain di WBA, WBO and IBF titles wey im lose for di fight. Di Briton get rematch clause for di contract wit Usyk, and later confirm sey im go take am.

""But dat na my concern for di fight - Joshua dey weak. Im don dey like dat for long. ""I bin think sey Joshua go dey too big for Usyk, but I know sey e dey dia at di end, den dem go outbox am. Usyk nearly catch am towards di end."" Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn admit say di defeat ""surprise"" am. ""Im go need to make fundamental changes, im go need to box differently,"" Hearn tell BBC Radio 5 Live afta di fight. ""I no see AJ taking a 10-round fight, im dey box only twice a year and maybe dat something we need to consider.  ""AS im dey comot di only thing e go dey think na Oleksandr Usyk. e go dey think: 'How I fit win am, how  I fit improve?' Im dey obsessed wit improving.  ""I just feel much Anthony Joshua dey for dat fight but im go need do a lot more for di rematch to be victorious."" BBC Sport Coral Barry, for Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Even for defeat, Joshua na classy fighter.  Wetin we hear be say afta di fight di heavyweight dey go straight to di hospital to treat one bad eye injury. But just as im do wen Andy Ruiz Jr beat am for New York, Joshua tok to tori pipo. Hours afta di 65,000-plus crowd leave di Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, a bruised Joshua sit down and e no make any excuse for im performance. Dis no be something wey pipo dey too see for boxing world to accept defeat by di better fighter. You no go notice anger as Joshua calmly answer questions about wetin go wrong. E just be like say everything dey okay from di two-time world champion. Joshua still dey confident, and pipo go need to see how im go overcome dis dark chapter of im career.

Chelsea vs Man City: Premier League predictions for dis weekend & match kick-off times	"Chelsea against defending Premier League champions Manchester City for Stamford Bridge na one of di big games dis weekend. Di Blues dey unbeaten dis season afta five games and dey siddon ontop di league wit 13 points. While City don lose one match dis season and siddon for number five position. BBC football sabi pesin Mark Lawrenson don drop im predictions for dis weekend games wit im guest wey be legendary drum and bass DJ and producer Friction, Wey im new single I Need To Feel don come out. Friction na Arsenal season ticket holder wey bin fall in love wit di club wen im go Highbury at di age of 10, and enjoy to dey watch legends like Ian Wright, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry. E don dey follow di club for more dan three decades. ""I bin grow up to watch some amazing players and I bin enjoy some very special times, but for di last few years e dey very frustrating to be an Arsenal fan,"" e tell BBC Sport. Games go kick off by 3pm West African time except dem tok odawise. Di last time Manchester City bin go Stamford Bridge, na for January, dat game dem bin score Chelsea three goals inside 35 minutes, but dat na before Thomas Tuchel bin take ova and dis na very different Chelsea side now. Games between di big four - these two, plus Liverpool and Manchester United - go dey very important dis season. E dey obvious say dem go gap di rest, but in what order? These matches, and dia mini-league, go decide am. Chelsea dey hot form now and e show for di way dem finish Spurs for second half on Sunday but I tink say dis go be open game, because both managers no go wan lose. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: I go prefer City to win it, from di London point of view, but dis go be tough game. City dey capable of playing di most amazing football, but Chelsea just dey strong dey go. 1-1 Manchester United still dey try to find dia balance. Dem go win plenty games dis season, but sometimes e go choke dem.  Di big question for me na if United fit win without playing well? I know say dem bin win for West Ham last week, but na narrow escape because of di penalty save for di end. Den dem change dia whole team and lose to di same opposition for di Carabao Cup in midweek, but na wetin di Hammers do too. Aston Villa bin beat Everton comfortably last time out and, before dat, dem bin play well against Chelsea and show say dem fit make life difficult for di top sides. United suppose win dis one, but e no go dey straightforward. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Friction prediction: Villa sign some good players during di summer but I feel say Bruno Fernandes go dey form for United, and Cristiano Ronaldo go enjoy imself too. 2-1 Everton bin fall yakata in di space of about 10 minutes for Aston Villa but dia problems no reach Norwich own. Di Canaries don lose all five of dia games so far and chop beating for dia house last weekend wen dem bin play Watford.  Lawro prediction: 2-0 Friction prediction: Everton bin get bad week but dem go win dis one. 1-0. Leeds neva win game yet dis season, and dem look like a different team from wetin dem be last season.  Dem don concede plenty of goals, though - 12 in five league games so far, and at least one in every match. Even wit dia poor form, I still tink say Marcelo Bielsa side go come good soon rather dan later. West Ham only league defeat bin come against Manchester United for strange circumstances, but I fancy Leeds to win dis one. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: Goals go dey dis game. 2-3 Leicester fit argue say dem no get luck for each of dia three league defeats so far, but dem gatz comot dat one for dia mind. Dis na tough game, even wit di slow start for Burnley. Di Foxes come from a goal down to beat dem in di Clarets past two visits to King Power Stadium, and dem go need to work hard to get dia season back on track. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: Leicester go win dis one. 2-0 Watford results dey up and down so far but dem get six points from dia first five games dem go dey satisfy wit am. Meanwhile Newcastle na one of five top-flight teams without a win and dia performances no dey too. I neva see anything wey go suggest say dem dey about to climb up di table. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: Dis game go dey tight. 1-1 Dis na Liverpool  first visit to Brentford for di league since 1947 and di whole atmosphere don dey to welcome dem. Di Bees go dey lively for di pitch too - Ivan Toney dey do great job and di team sabi score, e go give dem a chance for di games - or most of di games anyway. I just feel say Liverpool go dey too strong for dem. Jurgen Klopp don begin rotate im team regularly but e no mean say e go affect di results - e dey  generally get am right wen im drop pipo. Lawro prediction: 0-2 Friction prediction: Liverpool dey resemble dia old selves but I no tink say e go dey easy for dem. 0-1 I bin dey impressed by Southampton for dia draw for Manchester City last week. Dem neva win yet, but dem no be team wey look like dem dey any kind of trouble. Dat na why I dey support Saints to get dia first victory here. Wolves don lose four of dia first five league games and, although I no tink say dem go struggle for long, dem no dey strong as dem bin dey.  Lawro prediction: 2-1 Friction prediction: I feel say dis game na di hardest out of di 10 to predict. I bin dey tempted to go for a 0-0 but Saints fit win am. Dem bin look good against Manchester City last week. 1-0 Tottenham bin win dia first three league games of di season, while Arsenal bin lose all dia games, but dia results don change in di past couple of weeks. I no fit say I dey surprised by dia inconsistency. I tok am from di start say I no fancy Tottenham defence, add to di fact say Harry Kane neva hit form yet for dem for di league. Arsenal don improve from di way dem bin start dis season but I no see dem dey go on a long unbeaten run now. Dem fit draw dis game. Dat na di result di two managers go wan settle for based on dia circumstances. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: Neither team dey great at di moment, but I feel say we dey a bit better dan dem. 1-0 Crystal Palace vS Brighton (8PM West African Time) Liverpool bin finish Crystal Palace last weekend, but odawise di Eagles dey OK so far under Patrick Vieira. Dis na Vieira first M23 derby as a player or a manager, and how im side go play go depend on Wilfried Zaha - di way im go play even if im no dey score goals imself. Wit four wins from five games, Graham Potter Brighton side dey OK. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Friction prediction: As far as dis game dey concern, e go hot. 1-1"	SPORT	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/sport-58674414

West Ham bin get dia revenge for dia Sunday Premier League defeat against di Red devils as dem knock dem out of di Carabao cup for Old Trafford. Manuel Lanzinininth-minute effort, na im first goal in almost 12 months and im second since May 2019, bin dey enough to take David Moyes men into last 16. Even wit di second-half introductions of Bruno Fernandes and Mason Greenwood e no still change di game for di home side. Lanzini goal na reward for di early pressure wey dem put for  di host for as di game start. Three times for di final five minutes di visitors for wrap up dia victory, but Andriy Yarmolenko, Mark Noble and Jarrod Bowen all fail to hit di target. In di end, e no really mata.

Di Defeat come afta Solskjaer bin pick a completely different side - all of dem na full internationals - to di ones wey bin dey on duty for London Stadium. Im now get tough decisions to make about some of im fringe players, wey go now get even fewer opportunities to play. Anthony Martial na one of di players wey no really shine for attack, Fernandes bin replace Juan Mata for second-half, while Lingard, who, like Mata contract go expire dis summer, bin fail to deliver. Dean Henderson na anoda one, wey really no too much for im first appearance of di season to suggest say im go be threat for goal to David de Gea. Di doubts over Solskjaer go comot again after last week Champions League defeat for Young Boys. No be say any of dis go bother Moyes and im West Ham team, wey bin hold di Red Devils down without shaking.

Ever since den, I dey obsessed wit Liverpool. Kick off for di Games na 3pm West African time. None of these teams don win yet, but na Newcastle I dey worry more about. Wen I look di way Leeds dey play and I feel say di results go turn around for dem soon, but dat no be di case for Newcastle. Magpies boss Steve Bruce dey under pressure already and dat go only increase if tins go badly for dem on Friday night.  Lawro prediction: 1-2 Aqib prediction: If Newcastle score, den Leeds too go score - but I feel say wit 50,000 fans for St James Park, e go make di difference. 2-1 Shaun prediction: I bin write down 2-1 to Leeds but I go change my mind and go wit a draw, because Newcastle dey house. I see Leeds taking di lead, and dat go make Newcastle push on. 2-2 Wolves goal against Watford di last time na gift, even though dem bin play well for dat game. I feel say dem go pick up anoda win here. Brentford last-gasp defeat against Brighton last week fit affect small. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Aqib prediction: Wolves no really dey score many goal but dem be good team. Brentford moral high right now though, so dem fit collect something here. 1-1 Shaun prediction: Brentford so far dis season start well but I tink Wolves just start to get tins going. 2-1 Sean Dyche new contract na great news for Burnley. Dem need am more dan ever dis season, if dem go stay up. Di Clarets bin play well against Everton on Monday, just like dem do against Liverpool at di start of di season, but dem no get anytin out of either game. I feel say dat fit change on Saturday. Arsenal bin get dia first goal, and first win, against Norwich - but dis go be a very different game, and e go be a real test for dem. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: Burnley go fit try to bully Arsenal but I tink di Gunners go- go through dat - dem really need a win too. 0-2 Shaun prediction: I know Arsenal beat Norwich but dem bin no dey convincing. I fancy Burnley here. 1-0 Liverpool get good week so far wit wins ova Leeds and AC Milan and I feel say dat run go continue here. Crystal Palace bin get good result last week wen dem beat Tottenham, but I feel say dia result go dey go up and down for a while. Lawro prediction: 3-0 Aqib prediction: I want Palace to win and I dey see good tins wey go happun under Patrick Vieira, but na huge ask for dem to go Anfield and stop Liverpool, wey all dia best players dey in form at di moment. 3-1 Shaun prediction: I feel say Palace go score but we go win dis one. Our defenders don return back and we strong for our house. 3-1. Manchester City don score 16 goals for dia three home games dis season and I no tink say Southampton fit stop dem. Saints gatz adjust to losing Danny Ings, but I no tink say dem go struggle dis season - I no just fancy dem to get anything out of dia trip to Etihad Stadium. Lawro prediction: 4-0 Aqib prediction: I dey hope for a Theo Walcott hat-trick but I know say e no go happun. 4-0 Shaun prediction: City dey play well at di moment and dem fit tear Southampton to bits. 4-0. Norwich don score one goal wit no points from dia first four games, while Watford dey on di run of three straight defeats. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: Norwich no dey score enough goals to get anything out of dia games. 1-2 Shaun prediction: E dey hard to see Norwich winning at di moment. 0-1 Well, di Rafael Benitez revival still dey on for Everton - im bin change di team to spark dia fightback as dem beat Burnley. Aston Villa bin lose to Chelsea last weekend but dem bin look good for dat game for a long time - dem bin get plenty of chances for di first half. E go dey close, but I dey tip Dean Smith side to collect di points here. As good as Everton dey, we see as dem shake for dat game against di Clarets and I feel say Villa go give dem wahala. Lawro prediction: 2-1 Aqib prediction: Goals go dey for dis one. Everton don turn into machine under Benitez, although I feel say for James Rodriguez as dem no dey look im side. Im be beautiful footballer. 2-3 Shaun prediction: For some reason, I bin dey see 0-0. Everton dey look very good at di moment though, so I gatz go with dem to win. 0-2 Brighton v Leicester (14:00 West African Time) Everybody go dey expect Leicester to win these kind of games now, but I no tink say e go dey straightforward for dem at all. Brighton bin leave am late to beat Brentford last time out but dem dey form now afta dem win three of dia first four games. Lawro prediction: 1-1 Aqib prediction: I neva go for 0-0 yet, a bi? Goals go plenty dis weekend. 1-2 Shaun prediction: Brighton start dis season no bad but Leicester go dey too strong for dem. 0-2 West Ham striker Michail Antonio suspension for dis game na big blow for dem. I know Manchester United bin no too play well for dia midweek Champions League match but I no tink say e go stop dem from qualifying out of di group. Lawro prediction: 0-2 Aqib prediction: I hope say wetin happun against Young Boys go help United get back on track as dem suppose. 0-2 Shaun prediction: Antonio na big miss for West Ham, because im be big threat for dia team. I hate to tok am but United get real chance to win di league dis season wit di quality wey dem get for dia side. Cristiano Ronaldo go continue to score goals and Bruno Fernandes na baba wen it comes to making dem. 0-3 Tottenham bin fall hand last week as dem lose to Crystal Palace, and for me, all I see for dis game na Chelsea win. Dem dey enough to keep Spurs out, and dem get players wey go cause problems for field..

LAWRO PREDICTIONS Games go kick off at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated SATURDAY Tottenham neva do anything spectacular so far but dem don do really well to win every Premier League game 1-0 - especially because I feel say dia defence na weak link. I'd still fancy Spurs to win dis one and continue their 100% winning start, even though Son no dey fit, but I no dey to worried about Crystal Palace wait for dia first league win under Patrick Vieira. Lawro prediction: 0-1 Justin prediction: Dis game go tough for Palace. Dem no dey look great, but Spurs good. 0-3 Arsenal results so far dey very bad so far but surely dem go get something out of dis bottom-of-di-table clash. We know say Norwich go fight hard dis season to avoid relegation. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: Arsenal get better players pass Norwich have, but as tins be now e no look good. Norwich feel say dem fit get something dia. 1-1 Na so far, so good for Brentford wey still dey unbeaten afta three league games. Brighton go expect a noisy atmosphere like di one wey we saw when di Bees beat Arsenal for di first game of di season because di home fans go just dey enjoy dia self.

Leicester get a  bit of history against Pep Guardiola' Manchester City, including beating them for  last month Community Shield, but di Foxes go face a different animal dis time.

Lawro prediction: 3-0 Justin prediction: Based on Ronaldo history and how im dey always marks every occasion to do something special, I dey expect a goal from am and a win for Manchester United, based on say Newcastle no dey form right now. 3-0 Southampton na another team without a victory so far but I feel say their performances  better pass their results for their first three games. West Ham, meanwhile, don win two out of three and go maintain dia 100% record if to say dem no allow dia lead slip twice for home against Crystal Palace before di international break. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Justin's prediction:  1-0 Watford don lose their past two games afta dem starting their season with a win ova Aston Villa and I no dey see that run ending dia weekend. Wolves dey without a point or even a goal so far but dem don create plenty chances and surely that go soon change , whether Mexican striker Raul Jimenez dey allowed to play or not.

Togo national football team attack: Survivors remember machine gun ambush, 10 years afta	"On 8 January 2010, di Africa Cup of Nations for Angola bin only remain few days before e start. I bin dey di province of Cabinda, dey prepare to cover Group B for di BBC World Service, and bin also dey in charge of handing ova di BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy to di newly-crowned winner, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba. As di day waka dey go, unconfam reports of shooting, wey involve Togo national team, start to fly evriwia. Di detail bin no clear, but e clear say sometin serious don happun. How serious di tin be show wen I meet di squad as dem dey return to dia hotel for Cabinda city. I ask to speak to someone, dem immediately tell me say di team tok-tok pesin na dia best-known player - wey be Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor. Wen e siddon to tok, e give shocking details of di attack wey kill two members of di Togo delegation and result in life changing injuries to some odas. 10 years afta, dis na di tori from team members wey make global headlines and wetin happun afta. Togo squad bin dey in good spirits days before di 2010 Nations Cup. Dem just qualify back for di tournament afta dem miss out for 2008 and bin dey prepare to take on group wey feature some of di biggest names for African football - Drogba Ivory Coast and Michael Essien Ghana bin dey di same group.  Before di tournament, Togo decide to camp for Pointe Noir for Republic of Congo, just over 100km from wia dem go play dia group games for Angola city of Cabinda.  Cabinda dey separate from di rest of Angola, and instead of di Togo suad to fly from wia dem dey to di capital Luanda and den fly back north again, dem choose to drive. Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival.  Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change.  ""All of us bin dey enjoy, afta we don cross di border. Some of us bin dey busy dey listen to music. I remember afta 15 minutes wey we don dey drive we hear gunshot for di forest - we all laugh, make joke. Den serious shooting start."" Di first casualty happen before anybody even know wetin dey go on. Senaya remember Togo media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, bin stand to video dia arrival for Angola at di moment of di attack. Dem shoot kill am. Anoda player wey remember clearly those crazy moments na goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Im life change for just few seconds, as e realise say dem don shoot am too.  ""I hear di sound of di machine gun,"" Im tok, ""and for dat very moment I bin want move go hide, e bin dey as if dem nail me to chair. ""Dat na wen I see myself - both my belle and my back begin bleed. Dat na wen I begin panic. I say: 'Dem don hit me, help me, help me, I want see my daughter, my son. I no wan die here.'"" Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day. Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack. E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back. Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack. Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces. Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last.  Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey. ""No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus,"" Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack. ""We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more. Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes. Can you imagine? Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life. ""Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you. Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to.""  Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence. But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside. ""Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital,"" Adebayor tok. ""Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone. ""I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die."" Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials.  Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever. Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation. All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread. Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since. Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent. Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex.  Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next. For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen. Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home. In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged ""government interference"" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault.  Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery. Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally. ""I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem. I go back to school, take exams, work and write book,"" im tok. For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. ""E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,"" na so im tok. ""I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.

Michael Essien African team of di decade	"As 2019 don end, Former Chelsea and Ghana star Michael Essien don choose im best 11 African players from 2010 to 2019. Di last 10 years see significant moments for African football, starting wit di World Cup wey happun for di first time for African soil as South Africa host am for 2010. Di decade also end wit di 2019 Africa Cup of Nations wey hold for June and July for di first time instead of di usual January to February calendar. Essien own decade see am win European Champions League title and one FA Cup wit Chelsea as well as runners-up medal for di 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. We ask Essien who be im top players from di last decade. Enyeama na one of di few African goalkeepers to enjoy successful career for Europe. Im win di Israeli League title with Maccabi Tel Aviv for 2013.  Im go on to keep 11 consecutive clean sheets while with Lille and bin dey 115 minutes away from beating Ligue 1 all-time record of minutes-of-clean-sheets set by Gaetan Huard for 1993 wia e play 1,176 minutes without conceding one goal. For national team level, Enyeama help Nigeria win di Africa Cup of Nations for 2013, as di Super Eagles end 19-year wait for di trophy.  Vincent Enyeama arguably be Nigeria best player for di 2014 World Cup wen dem qualify to di knockout stage.  Di former Manchester City captain bin be key member of di Ivory Coast side wey win di Africa Cup of Nations for 2015. For club level, he was one of di first signings by Manchester City owners Sheikh Mansour which serve as star attraction for other big name players to arrive.  Kolo's acquisition signal shift in power for City because im come from direct rival, Arsenal. After a stint with Liverpool wey see am reach di final of di Europa League im end e club career for Celtic, wia e no only did he win the Scottish League titles but also bin be part of di team wey go unbeaten for di league just as im do with Arsenal for 2003-4. Di Cameroonian peak for Tottenham for di beginning of di decade and na one of di best left backs for Premier League under Harry Redknapp.  E impressive performances na di main reason why Gareth Bale, wey be left-back before, move to play advanced role. E form deadly partnership with Bale and dem become problem for right-backs for di Premier League.  Unfortunately for Assou-Ekotto, knee surgery mean say im career go pay di price but e be pesin wey pass expectations and become di best African left-back for Premier League. Benatia bin be big influence for Italian Serie A side Udinese, but na for AS Roma wia di world take notice of am.  Dem name am as di club player-of di-season for 2014 before e join Pep Guardiola Bayern Munich for di end of dat season. Benatia move to Juventus for 2016 wia e help dem win three Serie A titles. Koulibaly na di best defender for Italy for di last three seasons.  Im help Senegal to reach dia first Africa Cup of Nations final for over 10 years dis year and many pipo regard am as one of di best centre-backs for modern day football. Di only reason e still dey Napoli na say di club owner turn down many offers from top European outfits so far. Essien prowess begin to die down just for di turn of di decade with injuries taking dia toll but e bin still dey important for Ghana as dem qualify for di World Cup for 2014 and - e insists say im deserve place for e team of di decade! For club level im play key role and help spark di come-back against Napoli which help Chelsea win dia first Champions League for 2012. Yaya don win di Confederation of African Football (Caf) African Player of the Year award four times in di last 10 years.  E also score 79 goals for Manchester City, di most by any midfielder for di club during dat period.  Toure win di Premier League three times, one FA Cup, two League Cups and before e move to England e bin don win di 2010 La Liga with Barcelona.  E also captain Ivory Coast to dia Africa Cup of Nations crown for 2015. Di Liverpool star don be breath of fresh air for di last few years and many see am as one of di best players of dis generation. E don score 73 goals to help Jurgen Klopp men and bin dey instrumental in helping dem reach two European Champions League finals, winning di last edition. From im days for Salzburg through to Southampton and Liverpool - plus e performances for di national team - im don score more than 150 career goals with more than 60 assists. Di ""Egyptian King"" na di only African player to make di Fifa Best top 3 dis decade.  Salah don exceed expectations for Liverpool wia e win di Premier League Golden Boot for di two seasons with di club so far. Im be di reigning Caf footballer of di year afta im retain di crown for 2019. Mohamed Salah don net more than 202 goals for club and kontri dis decade. For di beginning of di decade Drogba reach im career high of 37 goals to help Chelsea win domestic Cup double and also win e second Premier League Golden Boot.   For di year 2012, Didier Drogba cement e legendary status for European football as im score di equaliser and di winning penalty as Chelsea lift di European Champions League for di first time ever. E trophy winning continue afta e leave  Chelsea with three more for Turkey as e help Galatasaray win di league, FA Cup and Super Cup. As e end im career for north America e show say e still get dat scoring touch for body as e finish as top-scorer for Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact and den made it into The MLS All-Star team one year later.  Arguably di greatest African Player of all time, Samuel Eto'o win e second treble for di start of di decade with Inter Milan under Jose Mourinho. Di following season e be Inter Milan top scorer with 37 goals as dem win Fifa Club World Cup and Coppa Italia. Those feats see am win di fourth of e Caf African Player of the Year awards for 2010.

Carteret Analytics use dia system to advise seven clubs for England top two league dem and 12 big clubs from Europe and di rest of di world too. Di data based on player value - dem go calculate fee based on dia performance for di club wey dey sell dem and di impact dem go get from di club wey dey buy dem plus dia age wey dey within (usually 26-30). Also, di value as per money aspect wey di player dey contribute to win football match and di kain influence wey im get to create and stop goal-scoring opportunity dem. By di time dem check dis value, clubs go make up dia mind to know how much dem want collect for di player head and how much too dem dey ready to spend ontop new player dem wey dem wan buy. Arsenal bin dey hot seat  for transfer deadline day- dem sell Alex Iwobi to Everton and bring in Chelsea defender David Luiz and Celtic full- back Kieran Tierney. But how come dem dey for di bad business side. Iwobi real value wen im bin dey Arsenal rise up to £46.26m but dem sell am for just £27.36m, wey suggest say dem undervalue am by almost £19m. Arsenal sign Ivory Coast winger Nicolas Pepe from Lille for club record fee of £72m- £21.77m pass im real value figure. And dem buy teenage defender William Saliba cheap from Saint-Etienne and let dia former captain Laurent Koscielny go to Bourdeaux for more dan £20m under im projected fee. But Arsenal bring in replacement for Koscielny for good value. Dem rate Chelsea Luiz for £34.8m but Unai Emery team bring am in for  £7.8m - no be bad deal for pesin wey don win Premier League and Champions League with plenty years of experience for England. Even though Crystal Palace sell dia best young player, dem do beta business for di transfer window according to Carteret Analytics data. And dem keep dia main player Wilfried Zaha, Palace buy Swansea striker Jordan Ayew for just £2.5m - wey less dan im intrinsic value. Dey also collect beta money for defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, although im value fit rise for future for Manchester United. Dem sell Wan-Bissaka for £49.5m, im intrinsic value for Palace na just £23.32m. But dem expect di value to rise £43m for United but it still dey short of di money dem pay for am. Everton surprise pipo with di signing of 19-year-old forward Moise Kean from Italian champions Juventus. And di deal no bad, dem pay just £4m ontop im projected value. Dem also sign Manchester City Fabian Delph for under £9m.Dem bin value di England international for £54.58m to im selling club. Andre Gomes' permanent move from Barcelona cost just £22.5m too, a fee wey low pass im intrinsic value to Everton. And of course, di signing of Arsenal Iwobi na anoda good business. But Everton no shine eye wen dem sell. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye move to Paris St-Germain fall short of im £26m intrinsic value. Di best business happun for clubs wey dey outside di Premier League top six. Wolves smart for dia business for transfer market, dem sign loan players on permanent deals. Benfica sign Mexico striker Raul Jimenez, wey score 15 goals for 37 games last season for club record of £34m- na good deal because im intrinsic value na £43.37m. Dem also pay less for Belgian midfielder Leander Dendoncker wey value reach £16.13m afta im join dem on permanent deal from Anderlecht. Oda clubs wey do  beta business for transfer market na Bournemouth, dem buy Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing for £15m - half of im projected value fee and dem sell defender Tyrone Mings to Aston Villa more than im rating.

But Labbe attempt to join di men team of Calgary Foothills, one semi-professional Canadian football club wey dey play for USL League Two - di United States fourth division make headlines. She actually make di squad and even play for one pre-season friendly, keep clean sheet sef before di league authorities ban her from participation onto say USL na ""gender-specific league"". Upon say some national football govning body dem don raise di age cut-off for mixed teams for youth level, but for professional game dat mata na no go area. Now at 32, Labbe don become di latest challenger to gender separation for di top level of di game. Even though say some national football govning body dem don raise di age cut-off for mixed teams for youth level, but for professional game dat mata na no go area. For 2004, football join body Fifa rule say ""dem must separate between men and women football"". Na di response wey follow di signing of Mexico Maribel Dominguez by Celaya, one second division team for di kontri football league. Fifa cancel one decision wey Mexican Football Federation give wey favour Dominguez. And dem stress am again say gender-separation na principle for football. Di argument wey dey ground na say man and woman no get di same power. E get some sports wey get performances gaps: for 2010 sabi pipo publish for Sports Science Medicine journal wey analyse man and woman performance.

""Wit di big change for di women league in di last couple of years we dey expect some changes dem for di physical standard,"" na wetin Bradley tell BBC. ""Especially di way wey sports science don advance, for strength, nutrition and coaching."" Last month Stephanie Labbe tok about her experience wit Calgary Foothills, she say she feel like most of di men get advantage pass her because of size. ""As goalkeeper I feel say e good because you dey face fast shots, hard shots and di game dey really fast ,""na wetin she tell tori pipo France Presse.

German elections 2021 results: Seven things wey we learn	"Germany centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) don claim victory for di federal election, as dem tell di party of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel say make dem no longer dey in power. SPD leader Olaf Scholz say he get a clear mandate to form goment, while im conservative rival Armin Laschet remain determined to fight on. Di two parties bin don govern togeda for years. But Mr Scholz say time don reach now to form new coalition with di Greens and liberals. Initial results give im party narrow election win over di conservatives wey suffer dia worst-ever performance. See oda tins di election reveal. Traditional parties of di centre left and centre right dey lead overall, but if you check am according to age, you go see interesting trend. Voters under 30 prefer di Greens on di left (22%) and di libertarian FDP (20%) on di right by wide margin, according to dis exit poll from Forschungsgruppe Wahlen. Meanwhile, di over-60s vote for di centre left and centre right. Only 9% went vote di Greens and 8% for di FDP. One former intelligence chief wey become right-wing controversialist bin fail to enta parliament. Hans-Georg Maassen stand as candidate for di Christian Democrats, but on di extreme right of di party. Until 2018, im be oga of di domestic intelligence agency, but dem force am to resign wen im doubt di existence of far-right violence for di city of Chemnitz. For dis election, im be candidate for Thuringia, one of di states for eastern Germany wia di far-right Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD) dey particularly strong. But voters put am for number three position for im constituency behind di Social Democrats and di AfD. Students of 19th Century history fit remember - even if na small - di Schleswig-Holstein question*. E become di word for extremely wicked and complicated diplomatic problem. Now Schleswig, at least, don return to di German election. Di party wdey represent di Danish and Friesian minority for Germany don make am to parliament for di first time in about 70 years. The SSW (Im German name mean di Voters' Union of South Schleswig) go hold one single seat. E gain 0.1% of di overall vote, but dey excluded from di normal 5% minimum for representation for di Bundestag becos e represent national minority. * Lord Palmerston famously tok say: ""Only three pipo understand am: di prince consort, wey don die; one German professor, wey don go mad; and me, wey don forget all about am."" * Which na how you fit feel afta reading about di number of possible coalitions wey fit govern Germany. Accusations of plagiarism (stealing anoda pesin work) bin tarnish di chance wey di Greens' candidate bin get for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock. But another female politician wey also face plagiarism charge bin surprise pipo wit victory. Dem bin actually withdraw di PhD of Franziska Giffey, of di centre-left Social Democrats, becos dem find out say she copy anoda pesin work for part of her doctoral thesis. Now, she be di newly elected mayor of Berlin - di first woman to govern di German capital. Her party defeat di Greens by 21.4% to 18.9%. In addition to di federal election, Dem also do referendum for Berlin to create more social housing. About 56% vote in favour of collecting di properties of major landlords (more dan 3,000 housing units) to become public ownership, while 39% oppose am. High price of rents don become flashpoint for Berlin: one online property portal calculate say rents don go up by 42% inside five years to 2020. Mayor-elect Franziska Giffey don tok say, she dey against expropriations (wey be make goment collect private property) but dem must to respect di referendum result. Wit 735 seats, dis German parliament be like e go be di biggest ever. But sake of di German electoral system, no one - not even di election authorities - know just how big e go dey. Di top candidate for each constituency get one seat: Dem dey 299 of dem. Anoda 299 seats dey reserve for di party for di 16 federal states, or Bundesländer. Voter dey rank di candidates according to who Dem prefer pass. But dat na only 598, so wia di extra 137 seats go come from? Dis na wia second-preference votes come to play, based on di population for each states and how many votes di second-placed party each each go get. Parties need to clear di 5% minimum vote share, or win three constituency seats, in order to enta parliament. As a sign of just how well di Social Democrats don perform, Dem even takeover Angela Merkel old constituency. She bin hold di seat for Mecklenburg-West Pomerania since 1990, di first federal election afta German reunification. Also her successor bin get symbolic defeat as di centre-right candidate for chancellor, Armin Laschet wey failed to win constituency seat for im home state North Rhine Westphalia. Dat no mean say im don comot from parliament, but e show di extent wey voters doubt am. Why dem do di election on di same day as di Berlin Marathon? Di same tin happen for 2017. Sorry, we no fit ansa dat one. "	WORLD	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-58713226

Ghana money rituals: Why ritual murder dey on de rise for Ghana	"Ritual murder be major issue Ghanaians dey deal with after de country start dey record multiple cases dis year. In de past, some of de most infamous ritual murderers target women, but recently children be de target of ritual murders for Ghana. But question wey dey on de minds of many people be why ritual murder dey on de rise for Ghana.  Unemployment be major challenge which most Ghanaian youth dey face.  Dis unemployment challenge create economic hardships give young people who dey look for get rich quick schemes to escape poverty.  Security Analyst, Adam Bonaa dey argue say jobless youth dey take up criminal means to survive.  ''While internet fraud, robbery, money laundering den tins be criminal activities de youth dey engage in, some people dey see ritual killings as option. ""De killings dey happen sake of Spiritualists who dey promise patrons money"", he talk.  Popular traditional priest, Nana Kwaku Bonsam explain dis better, according to him, 'fake' traditional priests dey demand for people to satisfy some very difficult conditions like bringing human parts den tins. Dis be one of de reasons why ritual killings dey on de rise.  Dis show in de recent Kasoa killing case where two teenagers allegedly kill 12 year old neighbour sake of fetish priestess allegedly direct dem to bring human parts. ""De misconception be say once dem use human blood do rituals, dis dey make de vodoo more potent"" Nana Kwaku Bonsam talk.  De implication be de needless killings to meet conditions of fetish priests off late. For popular traditional priest, Kwaku Bonsam, de use of human blood no dey make any vodoo potent.  After de murder of three kids for Abesim, he reveal say most fetish priests dey request for human parts be scammers.  According to Kwaku Bonsam, ""de only blood sacrifice traditional priest dey need to perform any ritual be animal blood."" ""But some traditionalists who want make money from unsuspecting people, dey charge den big monies in addition, dem go request human parts which dem know say go be difficult to do"", he explain.  ""Once you no fit do am de money you give dem lock, again you no go expect any vodoo money sake of you no bring de human parts"", Nana Kwaku Bonsam add.  ""In de end, monies wey all de people who visit carry give dem as part of de ritual go be for dem - that be how dem dey scam people"", he explain.  Another cause of ritual killings be de increase in adverts by fetish priests who dey advertise say dem fit double money or give people charm to make money.  De failure of key state institutions who for control content on public radio and TV dey make some youth vulnerable to de spiritual scammers. Those who go follow de public adverts, radio and TV shows go visit de fetish priests for money solutions dey end up going extreme lengths to kill innocent people as part of de ritual process.  Early dis year, Ghana Communicate Minister, Ursula Owusu make police arrest owner of Thunder TV and Ice1 TV sake of dem dey broadcast shows on money doubling rituals den stuff. According to Ursula Owusu, ""unregulated television stations dey promote some content which dey affect public order, public morality den rights."" Authorities for Ghana start dey shut down TV den radio stations who dey run adverts on ritual money den tins.  Security analyst, Dr Kwesi Aning believe say Ghana go continue to experience crimes like ritual murder sake of people dey see am as profitable venture.  According to am, ""crime turn profitable venture in dis country such that we no know what to do. ""Dis in addition to de weak criminal justice system for Ghana which dey fail to arrest and prosecute criminals dey punish  encourage more crime"", Aning add. Security agencies for Ghana over de years fail to deal with crimes in de country like robbery, kidnapping den ritual murders.  Dis according to analysts dey encourage more people to attempt criminal activities like ritual murder of kids sake of dem feel say police no go investigate and bring dem to justice. In 2019, de kidnapping of three girls for Takoradi go under police radar until media start dey report on de matter.  De many media reports put pressure on de Ghana Police Service to investigate, identify suspects den later retrieve de bodies of de girls.  After media make de issue of kidnapping a national issue, de police service make de issue step up dema investigations leading to arrest and prosecution of de suspects behind Takoradi girls who dem discover dead.  Ghana dey classify murder as first degree felony, publishable by death.  Ghana lawyer, Oliver Barker-Vormawor explain say based on section 46 of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) people who commit murder go suffer de death penalty. Despite de death sentence, Ghana shun dey effect de death sentence since 1993. Sake of dis, in practice death row inmates dey serve life imprisonment whenever court sentence murderer to death."

Phone changers: EU wan rule to force USB-C chargers for all phones - Read why	"Manufacturers go dey forced to create a universal charging solution for phones and small electronic devices, under one new rule wey European Commission (EC) dey propose.

Taliban Afghanistan war: How Nigeria, Africa fit dey affected in dia fight against terrorism	“Although some pipo believe say di war on terror go reduce because US dey comot Afghanistan, [but] di threat ... don begin rise for my continent.” Dis na di words of Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari wey im release di same day wey Islamist/nationalist group Taliban capture di Afghanistan capital, Kabul.  Di former military leader lament how di western powers no dey provide enough support to di many African kontris wey extreme militant groups dey show pepper –  like Nigeria. Di worry of oga Buhari say di west dey comot hand for di fight against global terrorism na valid one, for different-different reasons. Make we torchlight dem, because e get potential to touch Nigeria for body. Although terrorism don dey Africa tey-tey, oga Buhari dey right to “express anxiety” inside im 15 August article say Africa na di new ground for global terrorism, especially now wey Afghanistan don fall to di Taliban. Na wetin ogbonge international lawyer Prof. Akin Oyebode tell BBC on Friday. According to Oyebode, Africa na wia global terrorists like to flex dia muscle, because of three major reasons: di ‘weak’ goments wey boku for African kontris, borders wey no strong kakaraka and how e dey easy for terrorists to ‘enta’ di system. One of di dangers wey Oyebode fear dey happun currently near Nigeria, for di Sahel region (wey include neighbours Niger and Chad), wia militants wey dey linked to international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and di Islamic State, don begin gain ground and takeover more areas. Dis na after French president Emmanuel Macron announce for June say dem go reduce dia on-di-ground soldiers wey dey fight militants for di region – almost like wetin US (and western allies) do for Afghanistan months after. “We go likely see big-big acts of terrorism worldwide wit possible huge gains from weak or failed political systems for Africa, Asia and around di world,” na wetin Political Science lecturer Usman Solomon Ayegba write about how US withdrawal from Afghanistan go affect peace. Wetin go happen if extremists groups for di Sahel, Nigeria and oda places see di recent Taliban takeover as encouragement?  “[Di Talban takeover] go definitely boost di morale of terrorists around di world, E go assure dem say no mata how long e take, someday, dia dream to force dia belief ontop nations and regions around di world dey possible and achievable,” Na so Ayegba of Obafemi Awolowo University, one of Africa top university based in Nigeria write. Di religion wey Taliban dey practice na di Sharia form of Islam. But many pipo belief say na di strictest form of Sharia di Taliban - and Boko Haram/ISWAP for north eastern Nigeria – dey follow, wia for instance dem believe say woman no suppose comot without man by her side, and even then must wear cloth to cover most of her body. Also, like Boko Haram/ISWAP, di Taliban no support make young girls attend school if e no be Quranic type. On Wednesday 18 August, di Nigeria goment say di war wey Boko Haram dey fight na “ideological war” like di Taliban own, according to di minister of information and culture Lai Mohammed. E go on to say dis “na dis type wey dey dey hard to defeat”. “No be regular war… di insurgents no dey follow normal rules and in most times, dem dey make women and children become victims”. Finally, di concept of Jihad, di belief say Muslims fit fight war against anybody wey no follow dia religion, na one wey di Taliban and Boko Haram militant groups dey practice. In dis way, di Taliban fit see Boko Haram and all oda extremist groups in Africa as fellow fighters, wey dem need to give support to.   Di oda tin to worry about na how di weapons – wey Taliban dey control now – fit begin find way enter di hand of militant groups for oda places like Nigeria wia Boko Haram and ISWAP dey. Tori be say di Taliban don kolobi tins wey di US Army abandon inside Afghanistan as dem rush comot, including helicopters, airplanes, tanks and small arms. While military tanks and aeroplanes fit dey hard to carry dash or sell to pesin wey dey anoda continent, small arms like pistols and grenades na di real problem for African goments wey dey battle extremists, including Nigeria. According to one 2017 US goment report, America send nearly 600,000 small arms go Afghanistan between 2003 to 2016.  All dis small arms go be surplus for di Taliban, since na dem dey control goment now and no natural enemy dey.  Oyebode say although distance no go make am easy like that for weapons from faraway Afghanistan to enter di hand of Nigeria-based terrorist groups, na still concern for Nigerians because, according to di retired Nigerian lecturer, all e go take na for di Taliban to decide say dem wan begin support Boko Haram and ISWAP. “Di Nigerian [military] dey complain say weapons and equipment no dey…but I no know weda Nigeria go get mind to stand against di Islamists if dem [di Islamists] begin enjoy di support of di Taliban,” Oyebode tok. Afta di fall of Libya former leader Muammar Gaddafi for 2011, small weapons from di kontri begin enta di hands of not just Boko Haram terrorists but also alleged political thugs for dia use during di 2015 general elections. Nigeria dey on di road toward anoda major elections in less dan two years time. To fight war – or even do terrorism work - you need money. Plenty money.  And di kain money wey sabi pipo torchlight say di Taliban get reach billions of dollars. Afta di US defeat Taliban for 2001 and chase dem comot from power, dia money continue to grow; wit dis money, and dia present control of di Afghan economy, di fear be say dem fit begin use dis wealth to support groups wey share di same extremist religious belief dem get  - like ISWAP and Boko Haram. One 2018 BBC Reality Check tori reveal say di money wey di Taliban get fit reach $1.5bn. Who fit say di Taliban no go give financial support to extremist groups across Africa including Al-Shaabab for di east, Al-Qaeda for di north and ISWAP for west? E dey difficult to say wia Boko Haram and ISWAP dey get money wey dem dey use arrange weapons and carry out operations.  Financial support in di form of donations from ‘sympathisers’ home and abroad, remain one of di main suspected source and dis na something wey Prof Oyebode reason say Nigerians suppose dey concerned about. Buhari use im article take call on support from di west, say dem fit do more to provide “technical assistance, advanced weaponry, intelligence and ordinance” like how di US use airstrikes take deal wit al-Shabaab for Somalia.  Nothing dey to say di west, especially America, no fit come to Nigeria aid and use dia Stuttgart-based Africa Command (AFRICOM) to launch attacks against terrorists.  Nigeria na di largest black nation in di world, and therefore we fit say di way di kontri dey go, go determine di way Africa go follow.   Oyebode reason am say:  Nigeria “geo-political position [and importance] go sweet US belle for dem to come do intervention”.  As for Usman, e believe say big-big kontris like UK and America no get mind to epp again, say di only tin dem dey find na wetin go benefit dem.  “Nobody go support you, except only you and us as Nigerians!” Usman caution.  “Africa no be priority [for di West],” even Buhari bin warn inside im article.  Instead, di 78-year-old leader believe say economic growth hold di key to defeat terrorism.	WORLD	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-58293453

Taliban Afghanistan war: Wetin cause di fight-fight for di South Asia kontri?	"Afta 20 years of war, foreign forces don pull out of Afghanistan sake of one deal between di US and di Taliban militants wey dem comot from power back in 2001. Di conflict don kill tens of thousands of pipo and displace millions. Di Taliban don pledge say dem no go allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists wey fit threaten di West. But di kontri former rulers wey bin tough don gain entry for recent weeks pass Afghan army soldiers, wey dem leave to protect di weak goment. Di Taliban also make a pledge for national peace tok, but many dey fear a worse civil war wey fit happen. Nevertheless, Joe Biden, di fourth US president to oversee wetin don become America longest-ever war - war wey don cost hundreds of billions of dollars - don set a symbolic date of 11 September 2021 for full withdrawal. Back for 2001, di US dey respond to di 9/11 attack on New York and Washington wia nearly 3,000 pipo die. Officials identify Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and dia leader Osama Bin Laden, as pipo wey dey responsible for di attack.  Bin Laden bin dey Afghanistan, under di protection of di Taliban, di Islamists wey don dey power since 1996. Wen dem refuse to hand am over, di US intervene wit military and quickly remove di Taliban and vow to support democracy and eliminate di terrorist threat. Di militants escape and later regroup. Nato allies bin join di US and new Afghan goment take over for 2004 but deadly Taliban attack continue. President Barack Obama ""troop surge"" for 2009 help push back di Taliban but no be for a long time. For 2014, at di end of wetin be di bloodiest year since 2001, Nato international forces end dia combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to di Afghan army. Dat one give di Taliban strength and dem seize more territory.  Peace toks between di US and di Taliban start small-small, wit di Afghan goment wey no too dey involved, and di agreement say US go withdraw come for February 2020 for Qatar. Di US-Taliban deal no stop di Taliban attacks - dem switch dia focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and target assassinations. Na so dia areas of control grow. Dem emerge from di civil war wey follow di withdrawal of Soviet troops for 1989, predominantly for di south-west and di Pakistan border areas. Dem vow to fight corruption and improve security, but also follow some strange part of Islam. By 1998, dem don take control of almost all of di kontri.  Dem enforce dia own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduce strong punishments. Dem make men to grow beards and women to wear burka wey cover dem from head to toe. TV, music and cinema bin dey banned. Afta dia overthrow dem regroup for Pakistani border areas. With up to 85,000 full-time fighters, tori be say dem dey stronger now dan at any point since 2001. In terms of lives wey don lost, e dey no dey easy to say exactly. Di number of coalition casualties na wetin dem record better dan Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimate losses for di Afghan security forces say e dey at 69,000. E put di number of civilians and militants wey dem kill at about 51,000 each. More dan 3,500 coalition soldiers don die since 2001 - about two-thirds of dem na Americans. More dan 20,000 US soldiers wunjure. According to di UN, Afghanistan get di third-largest displaced population for di world.  Since 2012, some five million people don run comot and dem no fit return home, either dem dey displaced within Afghanistan or dem dey take refuge for neighbouring kontris.  Brown University research also put di US spending on di conflict - including military and reconstruction funds for both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (£706bn) up to 2020. Di obvious question na, Taliban go take over di kontri again? President Biden don express confidence say di militants no go overthrwo di goment for Kabul. But one US intelligence assessment for June conclude say Kabul fit fall within six months of di military departure. By early August di Taliban dey in control of about half of di kontri, according to research by di BBC and odas. By di middle of August, dem reach di capital Kabul. Di US bin say dem go keep 650 to 1,000 troops to guard di US embassy, Kabul airport, and oda key goment installations. Di Taliban say dem fit target any remaining troops. Di oda major fear na say once again di kontri go become a training ground for terrorism. Taliban officials insist say dem go fully follow di deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against di US and dia allies. Dem say dia aim na only to implement ""Islamic goment"" and say dem no go pose any threat to any oda kontri. But many analysts say nothing fit separate di Taliban and al-Qaeda, wit al-Qaeda fighters heavily involved and engaged for training activity. E dey important also to remember say di Taliban no get centralised and unified force. Some leaders fit want to keep di West silent by not starting trouble but di extreme ones fit no want to break links to al-Qaeda. Just how powerful al-Qaeda dey and whether dem fit rebuild dia global network also dey unclear. Den e get di regional branch of di Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - wey di Taliban oppose. Like al-Qaeda, ISKP don dey degraded by di US and Nato but dem fit use di post-withdrawal period to regroup."	WORLD	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-58234501

Video footage from di city of Jalalabad show protesters dey replace one Taliban flag with dat of Afghanistan as crowd dey clap for dem. Dis one follow reports of similar demonstrations wey happun for oda areas on Tuesday.

Dis protest dey happun afta di Taliban take over di kontri capital, Kabul on Sunday and announce say dem go rule Afghanistan according to a strict interpretation of Islam legal system wey dem call Sharia law. Taliban don tok say dem go rule Afghanistan according to Sharia law. Sharia law na Islam legal system. Dey get am from both di Quran and fatwas - dat na di rulings of Islamic scholars. Sharia literally mean ""di clear, well-trodden path to water"". Sharia law act as a code for living wey all Muslims suppose to follow, including prayers, fasting and donations to di poor. Di aim na to help Muslims understand how dem suppose live every aspect of dia lives according to God wishes. However, e get different interpretations of how to implement Sharia. Di last time wen di Taliban bin dey power, dem impose one strong understanding of di law upon Afghanistan. Dis include strong-strong punishments, like di cutting off of pipo hands if dem tiff and public executions for murders and adulterers. Muslims fit apply Sharia for every aspect of dia daily life. For example, any Muslim wey dey wonder wetin to do if dia colleagues invite dem to beer parlour afta work fit meet to Sharia scholar for advice to make sure say dem act within di law wey guide dia religion. Oda areas of daily life where Muslims fit turn to Sharia for guidance include family law, finance and business. Sharia law divide offences into two general categories: ""hadd"" offences, wey be serious crimes with set penalties, and ""tazir"" crimes, where di punishment dey for di hands of di judge. Hadd offences include tiff, wey di punishment fit be cutting off di offender hand, and adultery, wey fit carry di penalty of death by stoning. Some Islamic organisations don bin argue say di application of hadd penalties get many safeguards and a high burden of proof - Wey be difficulty in proofing am.  UN don speak out against death by stoning, and say e ""constitutes torture or oda cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and e therefore dey clearly prohibited"". Not all Muslim kontries adopt or dey enforce such punishments for hadd offences, and research don show say di attitude of Muslims to harsh penalties for such offences dey different. Apostasy, or leaving di faith, na very controversial issue for di Muslim world and experts say di majority of scholars believe dis one dey punishable by death. But few numbers of Muslim thinkers, particularly those wey dey engage with Western societies, argue say di reality of di modern world mean say make dem leave di ""punishment"" to God - and dat Islam itself no dey threatened by apostasy. Di Koran itself declare say ""no compulsion"" dey in religion. Like any legal system, Sharia dey complex and di practice dey entirely rely on di quality and training of experts. Islamic jurists issue guidance and rulings. Guidance wey dem considere as formal legal ruling and wey dem call fatwa. E get five different schools of Sharia law. E get four Sunni doctrines: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanafi, and one Shia doctrine, Shia Jaafari. Di five doctrines different in how literally dem dey interpret di texts from where dem for get Sharia law."	WORLD	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-58262483

'Who are the Talibans' wey dey at centre of di war for Afghanistan?	"US-led forces comot di Taliban from power for Afghanistan for 2001, but di group don gradually regain strength since and don dey seize territory again. As di US dey prepare to complete dia withdrawal by 11 September, afta two decades of war, di Taliban dey overrun Afghan military outposts, town and villages and surrounding major cities, dis one dey bring fear once again say dem fit overthrow di goment. Di group enter direct talks with US back in 2018, and in February 2020 di two sides strike a peace deal for Doha wey make di US commit to withdraw and di Taliban to prevent attacks on US forces. Oda promises include say dem no go allow al-Qaeda or oda militants to operate for areas wey dem dey control and dem go proceed with national peace talks. But afta dat year, di Taliban continue to dey target Afghan security forces and civilians. Now, as di US don leave, dey  comot dia troops, di group dey ginger and dey advance fast-fast across di kontri. Na for di early 1990's di Taliban, or ""students"" for di Pashto language, show for northern Pakistan afta di withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Di believe na say di predominantly Pashtun movement first appear for religious seminaries - mostly paid for by money from Saudi Arabia - wey dey preach a hardline form of Sunni Islam. Di promise wey di Taliban make - in Pashtun areas around Pakistan and Afghanistan - na to restore peace and security and enforce dia own serious version of Sharia, or Islamic law, once dem get power. From south-western Afghanistan, di Taliban quickly extend dia influence. For September 1995, dem capture di province of Herat, wey get border with Iran, and exactly one year later, dem capture di Afghan capital, Kabul, as dem overthrow di regime of President Burhanuddin Rabbani - one of di founding fathers of di Afghan mujahideen wey resist di Soviet occupation. By 1998, di Taliban bin dey in control of almost 90% of Afghanistan. Afghans, wey bin don dey tire for mujahideen ways and all di inside-fight afta dem drive di Soviets comot, bin generally welcome di Taliban wen dem first appear on di scene. Dia early popularity dey largely due to dia success in stopping corruption, lawlessness and making di roads and di areas under dia control safe for market to flow. But di Taliban also introduce or support punishments in line with dia strict interpretation of Sharia law - such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations for those dem find guilty of stealing. Di requirement na say men go grow beards and women get to wear burka wey go cover dem from top to bottom. Di Taliban also ban television, music and cinema, and no support make girls between di age of 10 and over to go school. Dem accuse dem of various human rights and cultural abuses.  Pakistan don repeatedly deny say dem be di architect of di Taliban enterprise, but little doubt dey say many Afghans wey initially join di movement bin get dia education from madrassas (religious schools) for Pakistan. Pakistan be also be one of only three countries, along with Saudi Arabia and di United Arab Emirates (UAE), wey recognise di Taliban wen dem bin dey in power for Afghanistan. Dem also be di last kontri to break diplomatic ties with di group. Di attention of di world dey drawn to di Taliban for Afghanistan afta di 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks for New York. Di Taliban bin dey accused of providing sanctuary for di prime suspects - Osama Bin Laden and im al-Qaeda movement. On October 7, 2001, one US-led military coalition launch attacks for Afghanistan, and by di first week of December di Taliban regime don collapse. Di group den-leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and oda senior figures, including Bin Laden, escape capture despite one of di largest manhunts for di world.  Despite di higher numbers of foreign troops, di Taliban gradually regain and den extend dia influence for Afghanistan, wey make large areas of di kontri dey insecure, and violence for di kontri return to levels wey dem never see since 2001. Plenti Taliban attacks hapun for Kabul and, for September 2012, di group carry out one high-profile raid on Nato Camp Bastion base. For August 2015, di Taliban bin admit say dem cover up Mullah Omar death - wey reports say im death na sake of health problems for a hospital for Pakistan - for more dan two years. Di following month, di group say dem put aside weeks of infighting and rally around new leader in di form of Mullah Mansour, wey be di deputy of Mullah Omar. Around di same time, di Taliban seize control of one provincial capital for di first time since dia defeat in 2001, taking control of di strategically important city of Kunduz. Mullah Mansour die for US drone strike for May 2016 and dem replace am with im deputy Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who remain in control of di group.

E don receive thousands of shares wen one Facebook page wey call itself ""Jacob Zuma deluxe"", post and hundred comments follow Many of dem dey pity Oga Zuma or some dey tok say e deserve to go to jail for di comment section. However, some question di accuracy of di picture. Di image carry one watermark wey show say na from one Twitter account wey post am on 8 July.

And one reverse images search reveal an almost identical image - without diformer president in it - and e don dey available online for long time. We traced am to one AFP photo database, wey clearly show dem take di foto in 2002 for Pollsmoor Prison, Cape Town. E also dey important to note say although di former president currently dey in prison, current Covid rules for South Africa mean prisoners no dey not allowed to mix wit one another. One Twitter account for one of  Zuma children, Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, post one image of pipo on one major road for di city of Durban, some lie down for ground in an act of protest. Di post come wit caption: ""Durban City, We See You! Amandla,"" wit di hashtag #FreeJacobZuma. Amandla - meaning power - wey become a rallying protest during di apartheid period. However, di image she use no dey related to events wey follow di jailing of di former president, and look like na from one different set of protests last year.

Although di shot na from one slightly different angle, di positions of vehicles, of di pipo wey dey lie down for road and di way dem dress look identical to di one Dudu Zuma-Sambudla use. One video show one confrontation between a group of black men and white men don attracted more than 300,000 views on Twitter, and appear to show part of di current unrest.
